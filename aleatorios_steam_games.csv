Exploring the Backrooms, you really need to be careful, because you are not the only inhabitant of this strange place.

As soon as I left the ship, everything went wrong. Communications were lost and my submarine crashed on the ocean floor. I survived, but my oxygen is running low and I can't contact anyone for help. All I can do is move forward with this operations drone as my only companion. Trouble is, it's been acting sort of weird lately. Almost as if it's trying to sabotage my mission... Anoxemia is a story-driven exploration game that puts you in control of the scientist Dr. Bailey and his operations drone, ATMA. Search the ocean floor as you discover and extract samples from the bowels of the underwater caves. Danger lurks in each passageway, everything from poison drifts to powerful ocean currents, mines leftover from the war, and mobile machines running haywire. There's also the ever-present risk of running out of oxygen. Fortunately, ATMA can help guide you to your destination using a few special tools and upgrades. Assuming you can find them, that is. The world of Anoxemia is both breathtaking and perilous. The seas are quiet most of the time, but as soon as you see a flashing light or hear a noise echoing from the distance, you know it's time to run. Of course, there are some dangers you just can't run from. Dangers you don't even know exist. Dangers from within... Also available in Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian languages! Features Unique sci-fi horror story that unfolds while you play. Explore 38 levels of unique underwater terrain. Find and equip several different items and upgrades. Solve puzzles that require quick reflexes and clever thinking. Voiced narrative that gives insights on the main character's thoughts.

2099390,Umbral Omen,"Feb 12, 2023",0 - 0,0,0,7.19,0,"A game of signs and symbols where you must use your wits and luck to deduce a shadowy omen. Features: Randomly generated puzzles that use a different list of clues each time. A relaxing and cerebral atmosphere, rich with themes of nature and the occult. A campaign mode, where new modes and modifiers are unlocked as you progress. Optional, high-pressure speed puzzles, where you must solve an omen with a time limit. Additional hand-crafted puzzles. Daily puzzles. Compete against your friends! Unlock new colour schemes and customise your game's look. This is a puzzle game with simple rules and strategic depth. Your goal is to figure out which symbol belongs in each space of a grid in the fewest moves possible, but you can approach this goal in many different ways. You might, for example, guess only one symbol at a time. This will give you clear feedback about each guess, but might be slower than making several guesses at once. You might focus on a single type of symbol (such as Sun) or try to clear several at once. There are a number of advanced strategies to discover and master as you experiment with the best ways to solve different puzzles. The modifier levels will force you to develop new strategies or refine ones you have already discovered. For example, in 'Stacking' you may only make guesses on the bottom row at first. This means you need to find ways to quickly gain information with small, localized guesses. By contrast, 'One-by-one' only allows you to make guesses with a single symbol until you have found all of it's locations in the grid. This modifier requires gaining information about a wide area quickly, but restricts your ability to gather information about multiple symbols at once.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/header.jpg?t=1676253213,https://www.lochandquaygames.com,,support@lochandquaygames.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,15,0,,0,0,0,0,Loch and Quay Games,Loch and Quay Games,Single-player,"Casual,Strategy",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/ss_ddfdc95c62068494b585c98679feb95e52ea9edb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676253213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/ss_7873d5d9e990c4ef69d8ddf6f1346dd94f80f0ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676253213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/ss_425e2196cd98e0bae68aab10e31a6a9e71d2caca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676253213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/ss_f34a28c623d69c05ba89b01f2c50e89acac890d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676253213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2099390/ss_ba260cff4d90438595a7467e394e32e4a653eabb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676253213",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256927341/movie_max.mp4?t=1674885677

I wanted to learn how to make 3D games and decided that making a game a week was a good, challenging way to do so. Arrowpoint is my second week long game. You've got a bow, a horse, and a burning desire for glory. Luck would have it that there's a mysterious beast wandering the desert nearby, so what are you waiting for? Go forth and leave your mark on the world! Arrowpoint is a simple game about hitting a bunch of targets and waging battle with a huge beast. It's fun because firing arrows from horseback is fun and because waging war with giants is fun. I'm releasing Arrowpoint for one dollar so people can join me in this crazy game-a-week adventure. If you'd like to share your thoughts, please leave a review or post to the Steam forums. If I get enough feedback I will improve the game based on what player's want. Thanks for reading this; I really hope you enjoy the game! Alex Schearer - Spotted Zebra Software Gameplay Ride your horse and fire at increasingly more challenging targets.
